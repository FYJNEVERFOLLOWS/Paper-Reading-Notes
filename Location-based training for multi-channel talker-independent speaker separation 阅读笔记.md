## Multi-Channel Talker-Independent Speaker Separation Through Location-Based Training [TASLP 2022]

Azimuth Sorting Training

Distance Sorting Training

We have proposed location-based training as a new training approach for multi-channel talker-independent speaker separation. We have developed two new training criteria based on speaker azimuth angles and distances to resolve the permutation ambiguity problem. In addition, azimuth-based and distance-based training can be combined to further improve separation performance. LBT outperforms PIT in separation performance as well as training complexity.

The DRR is inversely proportional to the square of the source-microphone distance in reverberant environments. [Spatial hearing: the psychophysics of human sound localization, MIT press, 1997][Binaural direct-to-reverberant energy ratio and speaker distance estimation, TASLP 2020]
