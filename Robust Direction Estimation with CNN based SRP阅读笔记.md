基于相位变换加权的可控响应功率**Steered-Response Power Phase Transform (SRP-PHAT)** can be interpreted as a [beamforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming)-based approach that searches for the candidate position that maximizes the output of a steered [delay-and-sum beamformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_beamforming).
