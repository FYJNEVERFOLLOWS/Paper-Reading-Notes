# Abstract
Presents a denoising method based on a fully-convolutional deep neural network. A two-stage U-Net model architecture is designed to model and suppress the degradations with high fidelity. 

The method processes the time-freq representation of audio, and is trained using realistic noisy data to jointly remove hiss, clicks, thumps, and other common additive disturbances from old analog discs.
