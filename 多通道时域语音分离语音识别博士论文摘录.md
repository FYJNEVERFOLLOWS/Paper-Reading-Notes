# Jisi Zhang's PhD Thesis Title: Time-domain Multi-channel Speech Separation for Overlapping Speech Recognition

# 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Motivations
*Distant speech recognition*, which uses audio signals recorded by microphones located at a distance to speakers, remains a largely unsolved problem.

The difficulty in *distant speech recognition* mainly comes from interfering factors (i.e., noise, reverberation, and overlapping speech from simultaneous speakers) in everyday environments.

Neural networks have been demonstrated to be able to replace the conventional STFT operation. 

The single-channel separation system is not robust to noise and reverberation, which commonly exist in audio signals recorded by distant microphones.

Multi-channel recordings from a microphone array provide spatial information related to source location, which has been shown to increase separation system robustness to reverberation and noise. However, most multi-channel separation approaches focus on time-frequency domain processing, and multi-channel recordings have not been exploited for the recent successful end-to-end signal processing framework. The questions of how best to develop end-to-end time domain approaches for multi-channel recordings remains an unsolved problem.

## 1.2 Aim and Objectives
The thesis will start by making an analysis of real conversational speech recordings to better understand the specific challenges.
