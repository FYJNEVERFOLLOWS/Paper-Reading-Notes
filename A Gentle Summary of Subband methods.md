# Multichannel Speech Enhancement Based on Time-frequency Masking Using Subband Long Short-Term Memory
Xiaofei Li, [Audio-WestlakeU](https://audio.westlake.edu.cn/Publications.htm)

The proposed method learns one network for all subbands, which encourages the network to learn the informations that are common to all subbands, as unsupervised methods (beamforming and Wiener filter) use such kind of common informations. By excluding the cross-band information, the proposed LSTM network need to model much smaller variability with respect to speakers and noise types compared to the full-band techniques, thus having very good
generalization capability in terms of speakers and noise types.

Only one TF bin is taken as input.

Dataset: CHiME3

The unsupervised methods [12, 13, 14, 15, 17]previously demonstrated that subbands contain rich informations for speech/noise discrimination and speech estimation, namely generalizing well to the unseen speakers and noise types.
